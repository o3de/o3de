INTRODUCTION
------------

LyTestTools is a Python project that contains a collection of testing tools
developed by the Lumberyard Test Tech team. The project contains
the following tools:

 * Workspace Manager:
     A library to manipulate Lumberyard installations
 * Launchers:
     A library to test the game in a variety of platforms
 * O3DE:
     Contains various modules to test o3de specific executables
 * Environment:
     Contains various modules to assist with environmental dependencies


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * Python 3.7.5 (64-bit)

It is recommended that you completely remove any other versions of Python
installed on your system.


INSTALL
-----------
It is recommended to set up these these tools with Lumberyard's CMake build commands.
Assuming CMake is already setup on your operating system, below are some sample build commands:
    cd /path/to/lumberyard/dev/
    mkdir windows_vs2019
    cd windows_vs2019
    cmake -E time cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config profile

To manually install the project in development mode using your own installed Python interpreter:
    cd /path/to/lumberyard/dev/Tools/LyTestTools/
    /path/to/your/python -m pip install -e .

For console/mobile testing, update the following .ini file in your root user directory:
    i.e. C:/Users/myusername/ly_test_tools/devices.ini (a.k.a. %USERPROFILE%/ly_test_tools/devices.ini)

You will need to add a section for the device, and a key holding the device identifier value (usually an IP or ID).
It should look similar to this for each device:
    [android]
    id = 988939353955305449

    [gameconsole]
    ip = 192.168.1.1

    [gameconsole2]
    ip = 192.168.1.2


PACKAGE STRUCTURE
-----------------

The project is organized into packages. Each package corresponds to a tool:

- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools._internal: contains logging setup, pytest fixture, and o3de workspace manager modules
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.builtin: builtin helpers and fixtures for quickly writing tests
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.console: modules used for consoles
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.environment: functions related to file/process management and cleanup
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.image: modules related to image capturing and processing
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.launchers: game launchers library
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.log: modules for interacting with generated or existing log files
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.o3de: modules used to interact with Open 3D Engine
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.mobile: modules used for android/ios
- LyTestTools.ly_test_tools.report: modules used for reporting
- LyTestTools.tests: LyTestTools integration, unit, and example usage tests


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------

The directory structure corresponds to the package structure. For example, the
ly_test_tools.builtin package is located in the ly_test_tools/builtin/ directory.


ENTRY POINTS
------------

Deploying the project in development mode installs only entry points for pytest fixtures.


UNINSTALLATION
--------------

The preferred way to uninstall the project is:
 /path/to/your/python -m pip uninstall ly_test_tools
