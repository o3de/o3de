//! \brief The primary interface for an application to have Crashpad monitor
//!     it for crashes.
class CrashpadClient {
 public:
  CrashpadClient();
  ~CrashpadClient();

  //! \brief Starts a Crashpad handler process, performing any necessary
  //!     handshake to configure it.
  //!
  //! This method directs crashes to the Crashpad handler. On macOS, this is
  //! applicable to this process and all subsequent child processes. On Windows,
  //! child processes must also register by using SetHandlerIPCPipe().
  //!
  //! On macOS, this method starts a Crashpad handler and obtains a Mach send
  //! right corresponding to a receive right held by the handler process. The
  //! handler process runs an exception server on this port. This method sets
  //! the task’s exception port for `EXC_CRASH`, `EXC_RESOURCE`, and `EXC_GUARD`
  //! exceptions to the Mach send right obtained. The handler will be installed
  //! with behavior `EXCEPTION_STATE_IDENTITY | MACH_EXCEPTION_CODES` and thread
  //! state flavor `MACHINE_THREAD_STATE`. Exception ports are inherited, so a
  //! Crashpad handler started here will remain the handler for any child
  //! processes created after StartHandler() is called. These child processes do
  //! not need to call StartHandler() or be aware of Crashpad in any way. The
  //! Crashpad handler will receive crashes from child processes that have
  //! inherited it as their exception handler even after the process that called
  //! StartHandler() exits.
  //!
  //! On Windows, if \a asynchronous_start is `true`, this function will not
  //! directly call `CreateProcess()`, making it suitable for use in a
  //! `DllMain()`. In that case, the handler is started from a background
  //! thread, deferring the handler's startup. Nevertheless, regardless of the
  //! value of \a asynchronous_start, after calling this method, the global
  //! unhandled exception filter is set up, and all crashes will be handled by
  //! Crashpad. Optionally, use WaitForHandlerStart() to join with the
  //! background thread and retrieve the status of handler startup.
  //!
  //! \param[in] handler The path to a Crashpad handler executable.
  //! \param[in] database The path to a Crashpad database. The handler will be
  //!     started with this path as its `--database` argument.
  //! \param[in] metrics_dir The path to an already existing directory where
  //!     metrics files can be stored. The handler will be started with this
  //!     path as its `--metrics-dir` argument.
  //! \param[in] url The URL of an upload server. The handler will be started
  //!     with this URL as its `--url` argument.
  //! \param[in] annotations Process annotations to set in each crash report.
  //!     The handler will be started with an `--annotation` argument for each
  //!     element in this map.
  //! \param[in] arguments Additional arguments to pass to the Crashpad handler.
  //!     Arguments passed in other parameters and arguments required to perform
  //!     the handshake are the responsibility of this method, and must not be
  //!     specified in this parameter.
  //! \param[in] restartable If `true`, the handler will be restarted if it
  //!     dies, if this behavior is supported. This option is not available on
  //!     all platforms, and does not function on all OS versions. If it is
  //!     not supported, it will be ignored.
  //! \param[out] asynchronous_start If `true`, the handler will be started from
  //!     a background thread. Optionally, WaitForHandlerStart() can be used at
  //!     a suitable time to retreive the result of background startup. This
  //!     option is only used on Windows.
  //! \param[in] attachments Vector that stores file paths that should be
  //!     captured with each report at the time of the crash.
  //!
  //! \return `true` on success, `false` on failure with a message logged.
