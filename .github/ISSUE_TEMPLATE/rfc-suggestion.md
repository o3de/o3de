# O3DE Suggestion RFC Template

### When using this template, you do not have to fill out every question below. The questions are there for guidance.

This RFC template should be used for any suggestion that is not based upon code or content related to the O3DE product itself. This template is for proposing new process models, approaches, or ideas to improve the O3DE community.

A hastily proposed RFC can hurt its chances of acceptance. Low-quality proposals, proposals for previously rejected features, or those that do not have any substantive value to the project may be quickly rejected, demotivating the unprepared contributor. Laying some groundwork with others in the community ahead of the RFC can make the process much smoother.

Although there is no single way to prepare for submitting an RFC, it is generally a good idea to pursue feedback from other project members beforehand. Keep in mind that you want other members to contribute and back your suggestion, which can drastically improve the chances of implementation.

The most common preparations for writing and submitting an RFC include:
- Talking the idea over on our Discord server.
- Creating a discussion on our GitHub RFCs discussions page.
- Occasionally posting "pre-RFCs" on the GitHub RFCs discussion page.
You may file issues in the RFCs repo for discussion, but these are not actively looked at by the teams.

As a rule of thumb, receiving encouraging feedback from long-standing community members is a good indication that the RFC is worth pursuing.
