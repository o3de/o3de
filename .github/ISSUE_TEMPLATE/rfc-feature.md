# O3DE RFC Feature Template

### When using this template, you do not have to fill out every question below. The questions are there for guidance.

This RFC feature template should be used for any feature that is not a bug or a substantial reorganization of the O3DE product.

If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going through the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC first.

A hastily proposed RFC can hurt its chances of acceptance. Low-quality proposals, proposals for previously-rejected features, or those that don't fit into the near-term roadmap may be quickly rejected, demotivating the unprepared contributor. Laying some groundwork ahead of the RFC can make the process smoother.

Although there is no single way to prepare for submitting an RFC, it is generally a good idea to pursue feedback from other project developers beforehand to ascertain that the RFC may be desirable; having a consistent impact on the project requires concerted effort toward consensus-building.

The most common preparations for writing and submitting an RFC include:
- Talking the idea over on our Discord server.
- Discussing the topic on our GitHub RFCs discussions page.
- Occasionally posting "pre-RFCs" on the GitHub RFCs discussion page.
You may file issues in the RFCs repo for discussion, but these are not actively looked at by the teams.

As a rule of thumb, receiving encouraging feedback from long-standing project developers, and particularly members of the relevant sub-team, is a good indication that the RFC is worth pursuing.
