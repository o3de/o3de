The Gem is enabled by passing --afr <pipelinename> (as well as --device-count <#gpus> with the number of GPUs to use) to the executable on the command line. <pipelinename> should be a (at least partial) match for a RenderPipeline name, for which AFR should execute. This RenderPipeline needs to have a CopyToSwapChain pass at the end. If no <pipelinename> is passed, AFR is applied to the first pipeline that posses such a CopyToSwapChain pass.",
