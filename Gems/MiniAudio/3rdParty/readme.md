This folder contains a script to grab and verify the 3rd party libraries miniaudio and stb_vorbis.

The license files for those libraries are present for your convenience (And the convenience of any license scanning tools you use), in subfolders of this folder.

During the build process, the downloaded libraries will be copied into the build folder, under _deps, so as not to pollute your source tree.
