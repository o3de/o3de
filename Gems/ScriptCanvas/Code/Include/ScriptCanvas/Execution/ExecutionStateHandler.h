    /**
    * ExecutionStateHandler provides RAII semantics and an interface for the ExecutionStateStorage for ScriptCanvas graph. It and executes
    * and stops the runtime graph, if possible.
    * \note this is done WITHOUT any safety checks. For example, the the presence of a good, loaded asset is required when Execute()
    * is called. If SC_RUNTIME_CHECKS_ENABLED is defined, the class will error on a bad asset, and early return if possible.
    * In this class general attempts to eliminate any branching done in the interest of safety checks.
    * All safety checks are expected be done by systems that own the Executor class. If safety checks are desired, consider
    * using the Interpreter class instead, which manages the execution stack from source file -> build system -> execution.
    *
    * Usage:
    * 1) Initialize()
    * 2) Execute()
    * 3) <stop function>()
    * 4) Optional (repeat steps 1-3), <stop function>() and Initialize() may be required to be called before subsequent calls to Execute();
