     * @brief A description of an event that happens at a given time in a motion.
     *
     * A MotionEvent could be a footstep sound that needs to be played, or a
     * particle system that needs to be spawened or a script that needs to be
     * executed.  Motion events are completely generic, which means EMotion FX
     * does not handle the events for you. It is up to you how you handle the
     * events.  Also we do not specify any set of available events.
     *
     * Each MotionEvent has a list of EventData instances that are attached to
     * the event. The EventData list is used by an Event Handler to perform the
     * required actions.
     *
     * All motion events are stored in a motion event table. This table
     * contains the event data for the event types and parameters, which can
     * be shared between events. This will mean if you have 100 events that
     * contain the strings "SOUND" and "Footstep.wav", those strings will only
     * be stored in memory once.
     *
     * To manually add motion events to a motion, do something like this:
     *
     * @code
     * motion->GetEventTable().AddEvent(0.0f, GetEMotionFX().GetEventManager()->FindOrCreateEventData<SoundEvent>("Footstep.wav"));
     * motion->GetEventTable().AddEvent(3.0f, GetEMotionFX().GetEventManager()->FindOrCreateEventData<ScriptEvent>("OpenDoor.script"));
     * motion->GetEventTable().AddEvent(7.0f, GetEMotionFX().GetEventManager()->FindOrCreateEventData<SoundEvent>("Footstep.wav"));
     * @endcode
     *
     * To listen to motion events, connect to the ActorNotificationBus, and
     * implement OnMotionEvent().
