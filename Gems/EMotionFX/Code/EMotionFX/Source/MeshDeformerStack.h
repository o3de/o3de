     * The mesh deformer stack.
     * This class represents a stack of mesh deformers, which are executed on a given mesh in
     * the order defined by the stack. The deformers will be executed from bottom to the top.
     * An example stack could be:
     * - Twist deformer
     * - SoftSkin deformer
     * - Morph deformer
     *
     * This would first perform a morph on the given mesh. After that a softskinning deformer would be applied to it, using
     * bone deformations. And finally the result of that would be deformed by a twist modifier, which would twist the mesh.
     * People who know 3D Studio Max will recognise this system as the Max Modifier Stack.
