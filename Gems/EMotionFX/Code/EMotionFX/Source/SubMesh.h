     * The submesh class.
     * A submesh is a part of a mesh, with vertex and polygon data having the same material properties.
     * This allows us to easily render these submeshes on the graphics hardware on an efficient way.
     * You can see the SubMesh class as a draw primitive. It specifies a range inside the Mesh class's vertex data
     * and combines this with a material and a possible list of bones.
     * The submesh itself do not store any vertex data. All vertex and polygon (indices) are stored
     * in the Mesh class. You can access this parent mesh by the GetParentMesh() method.
     * All vertex and index data of all submeshes are stored in big arrays which contain all data for
     * all submeshes. This prevents small memory allocations and allows very efficient mesh updates.
     * The submeshes contain information about what place in the arrays the data for this submesh is stored.
     * So where the vertex data begins, and how many vertices are following after that. As well as where the
     * index values start in the big array, and how many indices will follow for this submesh.
     * Also there are some methods which gives you easy access to the vertex and index data stored inside
     * the parent mesh, so that you do not have to deal with the offsets returned by GetStartIndex() and
     * GetStartVertex().
