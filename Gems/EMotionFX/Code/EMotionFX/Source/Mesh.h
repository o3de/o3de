     * The mesh base class.
     * Every mesh contains a list of vertex data (positions, normals and uv coordinates) and a set of indices.
     * The indices describe the polygons and point into the vertex data.
     * The vertex data is stored in seperate layers. So the position, normal, uv and tangent data is stored in three layers/arrays.
     * You can access the vertex data with FindVertexData() and FindOriginalVertexData().
     * The length of all these arrays equals the value returned by GetNumVertices().
     * So this means that there are ALWAYS the same amount of positions, normals and uv coordinates in the mesh.
     * Vertices automatically are duplicated when needed. This means that a flat shaded cube of triangles which normally has 8 vertices
     * will have 24 vertices in this mesh. This is done, because you can use this vertex data directly to render it on the
     * graphics hardware and it allows multiple normals and texture coordinates per vertex, which is needed for good
     * texture mapping support and support for smoothing groups and flat shading.
     * Still, each of the 24 vertices in the 'cube' example will have indices to their original vertices (which are not stored).
     * This array of indices can be accessed by calling GetOrgVerts(). The values stored in this array will range from [0..7].
     * The mesh also contains a set of vertex attributes, which are user defined attributes per vertex.
     * Next to that there also are shared vertex attributes, which are only there for the real number of vertices.
     * All vertices have the same number of attributes, and attribute number 'n' has to be of the same type for all vertices as well.
     * @see SubMesh.
     * @see FindVertexData.
     * @see FindOriginalVertexData.
