    /**
     * The Halton Sequence class.
     * Halton sequences are pseudo random numbers, actually known as Quasi Random Numbers.
     * They are often used in Monte Carlo sampling methods, because they are very good for that, especially for higher dimensions.
     * The generated numbers are always the same. You can however add some real randomness to it to let the random numbers you get
     * start at a given random offset (instance).
     * The values generated try to keep an as large as possible distance between eachother, to prevent groups of points very close to eachother at some spots.
     * This is one of the reasons why they are so cool. They work basically the same as stratisfied sampling your values, but with the nice feature that you do not have
     * to know upfront how many random numbers you will need. So you can keep asking for the next value in the set.
     * The values returned by the sequence are in range of [0..1].
     * If for example you want to generate random points in a 2D box, you can create a two dimensional HaltonSequence. Let me demonstrate with some example code:
     * <pre>
     *
     * // create a two dimensional Halton sequence
     * HaltonSequence seq(2);
     *
     * // generate 100 random points inside the 1x1 unit 2D box.
     * for (uint32 i=0; i<100; i++)
     * {
     *    float x = seq[0];
     *    float y = seq[1];
     *    seq.Next();
     * }
     *
     * </pre>
     * You now might want to ask, why not just use the Random::RandF() function for this?
     * Well, the answer is that the distribution of the samples is much more evenly with the Halton sequences as with just normal random numbers using Random::RandF().
     * When not using Random::RandF() you can get areas where there are more points as in other areas, so no even distribution. This can lead to variance in estimates using random values.
     * HaltonSequences converge much faster, so result in a more accurate estimate.
