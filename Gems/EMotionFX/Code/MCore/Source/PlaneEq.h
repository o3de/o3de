     * Ax + By + Cz + d = 0. Where ABC is the XYZ of the planes normal and where xyz is a point on the plane.
     * The value d is a constant value, which is precalculated. Now if we put a random point inside this equation, when we
     * already know the normal and the value for d, we can see if the result of Ax + By + Cz + d is 0 or not.
     * If it is 0, this means the point is on the plane. We can also use this to calculate on what side of the plane a point is.
     * This is for example used for constructing BSP trees.
     * So, from this we can conclude that the result of (normal.Dot(point) + d) is the distance from point to the plane, along the planes normal.
