    //! The abstract base class for every type of node in a Graph. It consists primarily of a set of
    //! Slots. There is no functionality here beyond managing the Slots and finding Connections. Any 
    //! useful functionality must be provided by subclasses in the client context where the GraphModel 
    //! framework is used.
    //!
    //! Slots are divided into two main objects: a SlotDefinition and the actual Slot.
    //! The SlotDefinition contains the predefined description of each slot that the Node contains. This 
    //! information is not saved with the Node data in the Graph because it is provided by the Node subclass
    //! itself (either hard-coded or reflected from some other source). The Slot is the functional part, 
    //! and contains any data related to specific instance of the Node (for example, the default value
    //! of an Input Data Slot). This data is serialized with the Node. Whenever a Node is created, either 
    //! directly or by serializing in, the Node class ensures that Slots are created for each SlotDefinition 
    //! defined by the Node subclass.
    //!
    //! Every Slot in the Node has a SlotId, which is unique within the context of the Node. 
    //! A specific Slot in a spectific Node is called an Endpoint and is identified by a pairing of
    //! NodeId and SlotId.
    //!
    //! Subclasses must call RegisterSlot() to define the Node's inputs and outputs, but it shouldn't need 
    //! to serialize any of its own data. This base class's Slot lists are reflected for serialization, and 
    //! that's all that should be needed in most cases.
