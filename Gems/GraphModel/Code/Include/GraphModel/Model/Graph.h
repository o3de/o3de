{
    //! This is the main class for the GraphModel framework. It provides a generic node graph data model
    //! that is originally intended for use with Graph Canvas providing the UI, but in theory it could
    //! be used with any node graph widget system. It is also designed with primarily editor processing 
    //! in mind, rather than runtime processing, so if this were to be used at runtime we may need some 
    //! improvements.
    //! 
    //! Data Model Goals
    //! * Keep it simple
    //!   (For example, avoid using the component entity system even though that's an established pattern 
    //!    in Script Canvas's data model)
    //! * It shouldn't know anything about GraphCanvas or any other UI representation; it's purely a data model
    //! * Make it suitible for multiple contexts
    //!  (For example, even though this is built for Shader Canvas initially, it should be generic enough 
    //!   to use for the Particle Editor or other contexts)
    //! * It shouldn't know anything about how the nodes will be used. 
    //!   (For example, any functionality specific to Shader Canvas, Particle Editors, or any other context 
    //!    should be added to some external subclasses of GraphModel classes)
    //!
    //! Key elements of a Graph include
    //! * Node       - The main building block of a Graph. Contains multiple input slots and output slots.
    //! * Slot       - Every node contains input slots and/or output slots that can be connected together
    //! * Endpoint   - A specific Slot on a specific Node; basically a {NodeID,SlotID} pair
    //! * Connection - A link from an output Endpoint to an input Endpoint (we could also say this is a link 
    //!                from an output Slot to an input Slot)
    //! * Metadata   - Every graph can contain generic metadata like comments and node groupings for example. 
    //!                But this is specific to the node graph UI system, and the Graph class just stores this 
    //!                in an abstract way to bundle the data together.
    //!
    //! For continued reading, see Node.h next.
