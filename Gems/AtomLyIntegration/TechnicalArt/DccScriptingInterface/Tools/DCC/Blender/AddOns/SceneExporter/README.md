This DCCsi tool is non-destructive to your scene,
as it will export selected copies of your mesh and textures,
re-path texture links to your mesh during file export.
You can export selected static meshes or rigged animated
meshes within the capabilities of the .FBX format and O3DE
actor entity.
You have options to export textures with the mesh,
or with the mesh within a sub folder ‘textures’.
This will work for Blender Scenes with or without packed textures.
