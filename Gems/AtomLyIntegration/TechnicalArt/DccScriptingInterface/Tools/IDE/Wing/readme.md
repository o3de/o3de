# O3DE DCCsi, Wing Pro IDE

[Wing Pro](https://wingware.com/) is a Python IDE that can be used to develop, test, and debug Python code written for [Open 3D Engine (O3DE)](https://www.o3de.org/), an open source realtime3D engine, for video games and other uses cases.  Each IDE is different.  Wing is a popular IDE for many Technical Artists (TAs) because it's relatively easy to set up and works great with DCC apps like Maya with less configuration.  It is also pretty powerful and you can do a lot of data-driven configuration with it (which we will be covering some of.)  We aren't picking an IDE for you, that's a personal choice, we are just showing you how one like Wing can be set up to provide a better out-of-box developer experience (so that you don't have to do the setup and configuration yourself.)  In fact, we intend to do the same for other IDS like PyCharm and VScode (and maybe others in the future, join the o3de discord tech-art channel [come help us build the tooling foundation.](https://discord.com/channels/805939474655346758/842110573625081876))

### Status: Prototype

### Version: 0.0.1

### Support: <u>Wing Pro 8+</u>, currently Windows only (others not tested but may work)

#### Latest Features:

- The latest version of Wing Pro 8 (8.3.3.1) is recommended, as there was a bug in the initial release that prevented Launch Configurations bound to a ENVAR to function properly (as described in this readme), which has been fixed. Wing Pro 9 likely works as well, you may just have to make slight adjustments to the configuration (covered in this document below)

- The DccScriptingInterface Gem (DCCsi) can be added to your Game Project. See [Registering Gems to a Project](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/project-config/register-gems/), and [Adding and Removing Gems in a Project](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/project-config/add-remove-gems/) which you can do through the Project Manager (o3de.exe) With the DCCsi enabled, you can launch Wing Pro 8 via menus in the main Editor.

- Some additional testing and improvements have been made and are in the in the current release (2210), including changes to better support Installer build folder patterns. See the [readme.md at the root of the DCCsi](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Gems/AtomLyIntegration/TechnicalArt/DccScriptingInterface/readme.md) for more information about advanced configuration.

## TL/DR: Getting Started

1. If you do not already have Wing Pro installed, [download it now](https://wingware.com/downloads/wingpro).

2. To get started using Wing as your Python IDE, please refer to the tutorial in Wing's Help menu or read the [Quickstart Guide](https://wingware.com/doc/howtos/quickstart).

3. Setting up Wing for O3DE, is pretty similar to using it with a Digital Content Creation tool (DCC).  Related Links: [Using Wing with Autodesk Maya](https://wingware.com/doc/howtos/maya)

### Using with DccScriptingInterface

The [DccScriptingInterface Gem](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Gems/AtomLyIntegration/TechnicalArt/DccScriptingInterface/readme.md) DCCsi includes some support for various DCC tools like Blender or Maya, as well as popular IDEs that Technical Artists use in development.  Using Wing Pro via the DCCsi is recommended as it streamlines some configuration, but it is not a hard requirement.

1. Enable the [DccScriptingInterface Gem](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Gems/AtomLyIntegration/TechnicalArt/DccScriptingInterface/readme.md) in your game project, using either the [O3DE Project Manager](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/project-config/project-manager/) or the o3de.py [commandline tools](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/project-config/add-remove-gems/)

2. After adding a Gem, you should [configure and rebuild your project](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/build/configure-and-build/))

3. You should now be able to utilize wing, here are several ways to start wing
   
   1. O3DE Editor > Menubar > StudioTools > IDE > Wing
   
   2. Using a .bat file: "DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\win_launch_wingide.bat"
   
   3. From the commandline (seen below)

To get started, you can launch Wing from a Win CMD prompt, first make sure your engine is initialized (if you are using an installer build, it already should be.)  If you are building from source, make sure Python is initialized before using Wing.

```shell
# First, ensure that your engine build has O3DE Python setup!
> cd C:\path\to\o3de\
> .\get_python.bat

# change to the dccsi root
cd C:\path\to\o3de\Gems\AtomLyIntegration\TechnicalArt\DccScriptingInterface
# python.cmd in this folder, wraps o3de python
> .\python.cmd Tools\IDE\Wing\start.py
```

Note: You will also want to set up Wing for use as a external debugger (see the next Debugging section below)

# Debugging

When debugging Python code running under O3DE, the debug process is initiated from outside of Wing, and must connect to the IDE. This is done with wingdbstub according to the detailed instructions in the [Debugging Externally Launched Code](https://wingware.com/doc/debug/debugging-externally-launched-code) section of the manual.

### wingstub.py (for debugging)

This is necessary for attaching Wing as the debugger in scripts that are running

1. Locate the DCCsi gem folder (see above)

2. Locate your Wing IDE install, the default location is somewhere like:6
   
   1. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Wing Pro 8`
   
   2. Locate: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Wing Pro 8\wingdbstub.py`

3. Copy the file `wingdbstub.py`

4. It needs to be copied somewhere on the `PYTHONPATH`, for instance you could copy it here: `DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\wingdbstub.py`

5. Open the `wingdbstub.py` file in a text editor and modify line 96 to
   1. **kEmbedded = 1**

6. After starting Wing, click on the bug icon in lower left of Wing's window and make sure that Accept Debug Connections is checked.

7. You can put the following code into a script you'd like to debug during execution

```python
import wingdbstub
wingdbstub.Ensure()
```
#### HELP

Trouble attaching debugger?  Open your firewall and add an exception for wing.

- In Windows 10:  
  - Win + S and search for **Windows Defender Firewall**
  - Select **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall**
- In the allowed apps window:
  - Verify there isn't already an entry for Wing by scrolling through
  - Click on **Change Settings**
  - Then click on **Allow another app...**
- In the Add an app window:
  - click on **Browse...** and point it to your wing executable
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Wing Pro 8\bin\wing.exe`
  - click on **Add**

#### Notes:

- Similar setup documentation for a DCC can be found here, [Using Wing with Autodesk Maya (link)](https://wingware.com/doc/howtos/maya)

- If you install a new version of Wing, you should check the new version to see if the `wingdbstub.py` file has changed (use a diff tool?); if it has do the steps above again.

- For debugging to work, on windows you likely will need to add the wing executable to **Windows Defender Firewall**. When you start wing for the first time it may prompt you to do this, otherwise may need to do it manually (see **HELP** below)

# Detailed Overview

O3DE has a Gem called the DccScriptingInterface (DCCsi) that helps user manage the usage of many popular Digital Content Creation tools (DCC) such as 3D modeling tools like Blender (and others.)

Most modern DCC tools come with a Python interpreter and APIs to customize and extend the editor experience.  Likewise, O3DE has a Python Interpreter and APIs for automation.  Many professional game studios use this to create custom tools, workflows, pipelines and automation for content creation.  Technical Artists (TAs) often are the discipline doing this type of development work, and utilize Python to do so, but may not be as fluent in developer tools as a C++ engineer; thus there is an importance on having good development environments.  

The DCCsi integrations are workflow integrations with the intent to provide an improved ease-of-use experience when these tools are used to author source content for O3DE.  The same can be said for IDEs and custom tooling. These novice to intermediate TAs that want to just jump in and start creating, but don't know how to get started, are the target audience for this integration... the goal is to get you up and running with minimal set up.

The DCCsi helps with aspects such as, configuration and settings, launching DCC tools, and IDEs, and bootstrapping them with O3DE extensions (generally python scripts using the DCC tools APIs to automate tasks)

#### Launch Configurations
Many IDEs such as Wing allow you to configure one or more launch configurations, each configuration can be used to define an interpretter as well as other aspects such as a environment or additional commands.  With the DCCsi, we can use these to define each DCC applications python, so we can test code by running it in that iterpretter.  These are defined in a data-driven way by an EVAR in the launch environment. The ENVAR is set to a path string of the interpretter location:

The project default is currently configured like this inside of wing:
  - `${O3DE_DEV}` = '${O3DE_DEV}\python\runtime\python-3.10.5-rev1-windows\python\python.exe'

You can inspect the project default settings:

`Wing > menubar > Project > Project properties ...`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23222931/201771477-ba8c5ca1-b1b4-4cf3-885e-b142d60513b0.png)


After starting Wing using the DCCsi project, you can inspect which Launch Configurations have been defined with the following menu:

`Wing > menubar > Project > Launch Configurations`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23222931/201770286-ad988b4b-ecde-451c-8379-93938c4b055c.png)

- Supports O3DE Python as Launch Configuration:
  
  - `${DCCSI_PY_BASE}`

- Supports Blender Python as a Launch Configuration:
  
  - `${DCCSI_PY_BLENDER}`

- Supports MayaPy as a Launch Configuration:
  
  - `${DCCSI_PY_MAYA}`

- Supports Substance3D Designer Python as a Launch Configuration:
  
  - `${DCCSI_PY_SUBSTANCE}`

You can change the current Launch environment a couple of differenty ways:
1. Globally, access the 'Launch Configuations' via the following menu:
    - `Wing > Python Shell (tab) > options > Use Environment > (select a launch environment)`

2. On Script Executtion:
    - press the green Start button in the upper-right of the main toolbar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23222931/201775116-1030cf5b-9749-464e-9595-fbe7c09839cd.png)
    - or the F5 button
    - In the dialog box:
        - set the primary pull down to `Use Selected Launch Configuration`
        - set the second pulldown to the interpretter you'd like to run

# Additional Information

To use Wing, there may be things you need to do locally to get set up (and we may automate some of these steps in the future.)  

## What to know ...

The default location for the DCCsi Gem folder is something like:

`C:/path/to/o3de/Gems/AtomLyIntegration/TechnicalArt/DccScriptingInterface`

But you are reading this, so you have already found it :)

### General ...

There are many ways to work with O3DE, especially as a developer. Here are some things to be aware of...

- What type of user are you?  Are you a C++ engine developer, a Technical Artist (TA) working in source, or a TA on a game team using a pre-built engine; or a end user that is a novice with little python experience?

- O3DE has it's own python interpreter, the python version and/or location could change as upgrades happen. We may want to use this O3DE python as the IDE interpreter when running our code (likewise we may want to use a compatible  DCC tools interpreter); and this is one reason why the env is data-driven and configurable.)

  - O3DE python is in a location such as: `c:\path\to\o3de\python\*`

- O3DE builds it's own Qt dlls (and other binaries), provides it's own access to PySide2, installs python package dependencies during cmake configuration; we need to ensure we are bootstrapping access to these things, so we are developing and testing code with the same interpreter, using the same packages and code access, and operating in an environment similar to the editor! (and there are other ways to operate, like creating a standalone PySide2 gui application. A topic for another time perhaps.)

- We also want to interface with a number of DCC applications, each with their own python interpreters and configuration concerns.  So we might want to use those python.exe's as the IDE interpreter, access their APIs, and manage compatible package dependencies; we might have common shared code running across these tools ... things can get out of hand and rather confusing quickly (this IDE integration attempts to solve some of this nightmare for you.)

- Are you using the O3DE installer? The release, or the nightly? What platform are you on?  All of these decisions have an impact on development as well, and we want to be able to configure our development environments in a way that deals with the differences.
  
  - These will have different install locations (and these locations have changed over time as the engine matures.)
    
    - Nightly:  `C:\O3DE\0.0.0.0`
    
    - Release: `C:\O3DE\22.05.0`
    
    - You can customize the install location...
  
  - The installer is pre-built, so it has a known folder structure like this:
    
    - `C:\O3DE\0.0.0.0\bin\Windows\profile\Default\editor.exe`

- But you might be building from source.  You might have multiple engine repos cloned locally, they may be on different branches.  You can build in an engine-centric way, or a project-centric way, and developers choose their cmake configuration and build folder.  Configuration needs to account for these many options.  This guide is geared towards developers, and developers need to be aware of these things.

- Be aware of your development set up. Here is an example of a location a developer may work with locally on a day-to-day basis. This example would be a developer building from source, working on windows, building the Editor target in profile, with a custom build folder path, and building in an engine-centric way.  This might be common for a developer that does a lot of branch hoping.  If you have multiple test branches, and work with with multiple game projects, you might work this way.
  
  - `C:\depot\o3de-dev\build\bin\profile\editor.exe`

- This is not a guide for actually developing python code and tools for the O3DE editor ([that does exist however](https://www.o3de.org/docs/learning-guide/tutorials/extend-the-editor/shape-example-py/)); this guide is focused on how Wing IDE is setup.

- This guide likewise isn't focus very much on DCC tools or their configuration, however it does touch on these topics as they are concerned with Wing, like picking Blender, or MayaPy.exe as your IDE interpreter (aka Launch Configuration)

- This is not an [O3DE build guide](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/build/configure-and-build/), it assumes you either have built from source (and know where your build folder is!), or that you have a pre-built install (and likewise know where that is located, and have some knowledge of the folder structure.)

### Specifics ...

Location of the DCCsi gem folder:

    `C:\path\to\o3de\Gems\AtomLyIntegration\TechnicalArt\DccScriptingInterface`

In the root of the DCCsi, one of the files will start O3DE python, you can start here for running and testing code outside of an IDE or the Editor:

   ` DccScriptingInterface\python.cmd`

The actual interpreter that runs is somewhere like

    `o3de\python\runtime\python-3.10.5-rev1-windows\python\python.exe`

The folder for Wing developers is here:

    `DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing`

It's this last location we will be most concerned with.

There is also a windows .bat launcher for Wing in this location:

    `DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\win_launch_wingide.bat`

This is an alternative to launching from the editor menu, or using the scripted approach of starting wing from the dccsi cmd:

    `.\python.cmd Tools\IDE\Wing\start.py`

Development is a catch-22, sometimes the script framework is buggy and broken (or simply a change is wip), and you need a reliable fallback for your dev environment.  This is why there are multiple entrypoints, with the .bat file as a fallback if other methods do not function correctly.

# Advanced Setup ...

Here are some more detailed set up instructions that hopefully help you better understand how Wing and the DCCsi are setup, and how you could modify or extend the configuration.

## Configure O3DE .bat Env:

This section is for developers who desire to configure and start via the .bat file

    `DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\win_launch_wingide.bat`

To make sure we can alter the Wing environment, to work with your set up, you will want to locate this file:

    `DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\Env_Dev.bat.example`

Then you will want to copy it, and rename the copy:

    `DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\Env_Dev.bat`

What this file provides, is the ability and opportunity to make ENVAR settings and overrides prior to starting WingIDE from the .bat file launcher.  If you have already found that the launcher didn't work for you, this is a section you will want to pay attention to.

These  ENVARs set/override  the default  located in the windows dev env:

`DccScriptingInterface\Tools\Dev\Windows\Env_IDE_Wing.bat`

You may find the following ENVARs useful to set:

The default supported version is Wing 8 Pro, if your IDE is installed in the default location  you should not have to  set anything.  But  if you need  to configure the version and location you can set/override these ENVARs

`set DCCSI_WING_VERSION_MAJOR=8`

`set "WINGHOME=%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Wing Pro %DCCSI_WING_VERSION_MAJOR%"`

and this ENVARwill allow you to launch  with a different  wing  project file then the default

`set "WING_PROJ=%PATH_DCCSIG%\Tools\IDE\Wing\.solutions\DCCsi_%DCCSI_WING_VERSION_MAJOR%x.wpr"`

If you are using a version of Wing 7, these ENVARscan be set

`set DCCSI_WING_VERSION_MAJOR=7`
`set DCCSI_WING_VERSION_MINOR=2`

`set "WINGHOME=%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Wing Pro %DCCSI_WING_VERSION_MAJOR%.%DCCSI_WING_VERSION_MINOR%"`

## Configure O3DE Dynamic Python Env

There is a python driven approach to configuration, settings, bootstrapping and launching apps like Wing.  The files we will be most concerned with are:

The primary settings file, which is distributed.  This has default settings defined.

    `DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\settings.json`

This is a secondary settings file that can be manually made, or generated, for developers.  This file allows a developer to make local overrides to ENVARs and settings, overrides in this file will take precedence over the defaults.

   ` DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\settings.local.json`

### Config.py and settings.local.json

If you are starting Wing (or other tools) from the Editor menu's, then you may not need to do much configuration.  Because the Editor has a python framework, we can access data via `azlmbr` , and retrieve data such as the engine location (see the [dccsi editor  bootstrap.py]([o3de/bootstrap.py at development · o3de/o3de · GitHub](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Gems/AtomLyIntegration/TechnicalArt/DccScriptingInterface/Editor/Scripts/bootstrap.py)) .)  You'll see paths and associated ENVARs are set such as:

```python
# base paths
O3DE_DEV = Path(azlmbr.paths.engroot).resolve()
PATH_O3DE_BIN = Path(azlmbr.paths.executableFolder).resolve()
PATH_O3DE_PROJECT = Path(azlmbr.paths.projectroot).resolve()
```

These are propagated (as ENVARs) into the `Wing\config.py `

There is additional support to start via scripting. This is the same setup that the Editor uses to start the external IDE application. It makes use of a `settings.json` (default settings), and `settings.local.json` (user settings and overrides) within the o3de DCCsi folder for Wing IDE. These are utilized along with the addition of a `config.py` and `start.py` in the folder. This follows the patterns similar to how Blender, or Maya, can be launched from the O3DE menus, or in a scripted manner rather then legacy windows .bat files.

Additionally, if you are developer you may want or need to alter the default configuration, for instance if you are downloading and building from source, then you may not have a standard install path, or you may have a custom cmake build path for binaries - and since the DCCsi, DCC apps, and IDEs such as Wing want to work with engine data, we may need to define where these things are.  You can use the Wing `config.py` to generate a `settings.local.json` file from CLI.

To generate a `settings.local.json` (which you can then modify with overrides to paths and other settings)::

    1. Open a Windows Command Prompt (CMD)

    2. Change directory to:

```batch
cd C:\path\to\o3de\Gems\AtomLyIntegration\TechnicalArt\DccScriptingInterface
```

    3. Run the Wing `config.py` script:

```batch
.\python Tools\IDE\Wing\config.py
```

You can now open `settings.local.json` in a text editor and make modifications and resave before starting Maya.

There two ways, a windows environment via .bat file, or a start.py script

From .bat file, double-click the following file type to start Maya:`C:\path\to\o3de\Gems\AtomLyIntegration\TechnicalArt\DccScriptingInterface\Tools\IDE\Wing\win_launch_wingide.bat`

To start from script:

    1. Open a Windows Command Prompt (CMD)

    2. Change directory to:

```batch
cd C:\path\to\o3de\Gems\AtomLyIntegration\TechnicalArt\DccScriptingInterface
```

    3. Run the Wing `start.py` script:

```batch
python Tools\IDE\Wing\start.py
```

# Revision Info:

- This is the second working Proof of Concept. The first was a windows only .bat file based env and launchers. This new integration replaces that with data-driven configuration and settings, with python scripting to bootstrap and launch. (this provides a path to starting from within the main o3de Editor via a PySide2 menu)

- This iteration is developer focused, such as a Technical Artist. It does not have some of the end-user functionality or creature comforts that you might want or expect, yet.

- This version is only the integration patterns for configuration, settings, launch and bootstrapping. No additional tooling within Wing IDE is implemented yet, however Wing has it's own API and extensibility, so this could be an area for future work.

- Currently only the latest version of Wing Pro 8 has been tested: 8.3.2.0 (rev 9d633cb1c4a7), Release (June 17, 2022).  We expect this and later versions of Wing Pro8 to work fine, inform us and help get it fixed if it doesn't.

- Wing 7.x was previously supported, but it was python2.7 based and we are deprecating support for py2.7, and this includes deprecation of support for apps that are pre-py3 bound.

- Previous versions of Wing may still work, however you will need to configure and/or modify the env yourself. This would also include version such as Wing Community Edition.

- This readme.md is continually updated as changes are made.  Remember, this is experimental and still early, and refactoring to improve the core framework and scaffolding patterns undergo frequent revisions (but will be locked down over time.)
