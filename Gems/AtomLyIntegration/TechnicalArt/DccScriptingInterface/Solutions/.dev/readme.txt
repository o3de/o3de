We .gitignore the folder .dev:
DccScriptingInterface\Solutions\.dev

Locally we put two things here foor development.

1. pyi inspection files, this makes it easier to add a single folder
to IDE configurations for api inspection and auto-complete

DccScriptingInterface\Solutions\.dev\pyi
DccScriptingInterface\Solutions\.dev\pyi\maya
DccScriptingInterface\Solutions\.dev\pyi\pymel
DccScriptingInterface\Solutions\.dev\pyi\PySide2
etc

2. Pyside2-tools

DccScriptingInterface\Solutions\.dev\QtForPython\pyside2-tools-dev

These are not currently part of the O3DE QtForPython Gem
But they can be valuable for development.

Ticket to include them in O3DE: https://jira.agscollab.com/browse/ATOM-13861

You can manually clone them from here: https://github.com/pyside/pyside2-tools

Note: if you want to use them as a python package
1. you will need to add as a site-package (PYTHONPATH)
2. you will need to rename a file:
	this:    pyside2-tools/pyside2uic/__init__.py.in
	becomes: pyside2-tools/pyside2uic/__init__.py

Some examples are in: DccScriptingInterface\azpy\shared\ui\templates.py
