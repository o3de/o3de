    // The editor mode mask shader writes out the visible entity of interest fragments to the red channel and the
    // visible + occluded fragments to the green channel. In order to achieve this, we turn off depth testing and
    // instead allow all entity of interest fragments to be rendered, whereupon we perform manual depth testing
    // in the fragment shader and update the relevent color channels of the mask texture with the closest depth
    // values of the entities of interest that pass the depth test. As we cannot read and write from and to the
    // mask texture in the same shader, we instead use the blending stage to accumulate the closest relevent 
    // fragments described into the mask texture.
