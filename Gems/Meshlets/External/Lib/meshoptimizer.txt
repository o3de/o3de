The meshoptimizer library is not included as part of the O3DE.
When adding and compiling this Gem, compile the meshoptimizer 
library and add it as part of Meshlets.Static project (for example, in 
Visual Studio you simply add the library file to the project).
Once this is done, the Gem should compile and link properly to allow you 
to run the ASV sample 'Meshlets' (created with the MeshletsExampleComponent)


The meshoptimizer library and source can be found in the following Github link:
