# Welcome to the AWS Core CDK Python project!

This is an optional CDK application that provides two stacks:

  * A core stack to use as the basis for a project's CDK application
  * An example stack with example resources that can be connected to ScriptBehavior samples in Core

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.env`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) (Python 3.7+) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html about for information about how to set up
the prerequisites for CDK development.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python -m venv .env
```

Once the virtualenv is created, you can use the following step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set environment variables or accept defaults

* O3DE_AWS_DEPLOY_REGION*: The region to deploy the stacks into, will default to CDK_DEFAULT_REGION
* O3DE_AWS_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT*: The account to deploy stacks into, will default to CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT
* O3DE_AWS_PROJECT_NAME*: The name of the O3DE project stacks should be deployed for will default to AWS-PROJECT

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html for more information including how to pass parameters
to use for environment variables.

## Synthesize the project
At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

You may need todo a one time bootstrap, once per account, per region. The CDK application will prompt you on this.

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Optional Features

Optional features are activated by passing [runtime context variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/context.html). To use multiple optional features together provide one key-value pair at a time:
```
cdk synth --context key1=value1 --context key2=value2 MyStack
```

### Automatic S3 and DynamoDB Cleanup
The S3 bucket and Dynamodb created by the sample will be left behind as the CDK defaults to retaining such storage (both have default policies to retain resources on destroy). To delete
the storage resources created when using CDK destroy, use the following commands to synthesize and destroy the CDK application.
```
cdk synth -c remove_all_storage_on_destroy=true --all
cdk deploy -c remove_all_storage_on_destroy=true --all
cdk destroy --all
```

### Server Access Logging
Server access logging is enabled by default. To disable the feature, use the following commands to synthesize and deploy this CDK application.

```
$ cdk synth -c disable_access_log=true --all
$ cdk deploy -c disable_access_log=true --all
```

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html for more information about server access logging.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
