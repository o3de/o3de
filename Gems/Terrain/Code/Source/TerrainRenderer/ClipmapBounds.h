    // This class manages a single clipmap region. This is typically a texture which contains data
    // around a point like the camera. The underlying texture never actually moves, and since it
    // wraps it can be thought of like a repeating grid. This makes looking up data in the clipmap
    // trivial since it's just the world coordinate scaled by some amount, however only data inside
    // the clipmap bounds will actually be valid. This technique also allows for only the edge areas
    // of the clipmap to be updated as the center point moves around the world.
    //
    // The edges of the clipmap region will typically run through the texture, dividing it into 4
    // regions, except in cases where the clipmap region happens to be aligned with the underlying
    // grid. This means whenever some bounding box needs to be updated in the clipmap, it may actually
    // translate to 4 different areas of the underlying texture - one for each quadrant.
    //
    // This class aids in figuring out which areas of a clipmap need to be updated as its center point
    // moves around in the world, and can map a single region that needs to be updated into several
    // separate regions for each quadrant.
