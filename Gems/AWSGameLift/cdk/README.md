# Welcome to O3DE GameLift Sample Project!

This is an optional CDK application that provides two stacks:

  * A GameLift stack that contains all the GameLift resources required to host game servers
  * An optional support stack which is used to upload local build files and create GameLift builds

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute this application.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.env`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) (Python 3.7+) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html about for information about how to set up
the prerequisites for CDK development.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python -m venv .env
```

Once the virtualenv is created, you can use the following step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set environment variables or accept defaults

* O3DE_AWS_DEPLOY_REGION*: The region to deploy the stacks into, will default to CDK_DEFAULT_REGION
* O3DE_AWS_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT*: The account to deploy stacks into, will default to CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT
* O3DE_AWS_PROJECT_NAME*: The name of the O3DE project stacks should be deployed for will default to AWS-PROJECT

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html for more information including how to pass parameters
to use for environment variables.

## Edit the sample fleet configurations

Before deploy the CDK application, please update the fleet configurations defined in the
[sample fleet configurations](aws_gamelift/fleet_configurations.py) with project specific settings. 
You can either use an existing GameLift build id for creating a fleet or provide the local server package path 
for creating a new GameLift build.

## Synthesize the project

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

## Optional features
To create a game session queue using this CDK application, provide the following context variable 
when synthesize the CloudFormation template or deploy the application:

```
$ cdk deploy -c create_game_session_queue=true
```

You can also deploy a support stack which is used to upload local build files to S3 and provide GameLift access 
to the S3 objects when create GameLift builds. The local build path needs to be specified in the
[sample fleet configurations](aws_gamelift/fleet_configurations.py) if the feature is enabled. Otherwise an existing
build id is required.

```
$ cdk deploy -c upload-with-support-stack=true --all
```

You may need todo a one time bootstrap, once per account, per region. The CDK application will prompt you on this.

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
