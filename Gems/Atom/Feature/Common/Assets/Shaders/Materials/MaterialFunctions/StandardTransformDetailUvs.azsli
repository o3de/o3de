    // tiling. But for detail maps you could actually use either UV stream for tiling. There is no concern about applying
    // the same transform to both UV sets because the detail map feature forces the same UV set to be used for all detail maps.
    // Note we might be able to combine these into a single UV similar to what Skin.materialtype does,
    // but we would need to address how it works with the parallax code below that indexes into the m_detailUV array.
