// Specular IBL reflection pipeline:
// Stencil -> BlendWeight -> GlobalFullscreen -> RenderOuter -> RenderInner -> Composite
// -------
//
// This shader stencils the pixels covered by inner probe volumes.  This will
// exclude them from blending operations in the later passes since inner volumes
// always blend at 100%.  Note that this shader only considers pixels that were
// stenciled with the UseIBLSpecularPass value when they were rendered in the forward pass.
// It increases the stencil value if they are in an inner volume.
