         * This class represents a blob of platform-specific PipelineLibrary data that can be serialized
         * to and from disk, speeding up driver compilation time and memory consumption.
         *
         * Pipeline state data is expensive to compile and results in a lot of duplicated memory
         * when pipeline states have little variance (for example, the same byte code but different
         * render state). The pipeline library allows the platform to de-duplicate these identical
         * components. Since this data is platform and driver specific, it gets serialized as an opaque
         * blob.
         *
         * Another restriction enforced by certain platforms is that they won't actually copy the data,
         * since it can be quite large. For example, if a pipeline library exists per thread, it is
         * preferred to not copy the data N times.
         *
         * Therefore, this class is designed to be immutable after creation and support reference counting.
         * This allows the platform to safely hold a reference and guarantees that the memory is not mutated
         * externally.
