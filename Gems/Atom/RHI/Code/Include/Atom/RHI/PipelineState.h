    //! PipelineState is a multi-device class (representing a DevicePipelineState on multiple devices).
    //! It holds a map of device-specific DevicePipelineState objects, which can be addressed with a device index.
    //! The class is initialized with a device mask (1 bit per device), which initializes one DevicePipelineState
    //! for each bit set and stores them in a map.
    //! The API then forwards all calls to the all device-specific DevicePipelineState objects by iterating over them
    //! and forwarding the call.
    //! A device-specific DevicePipelineState can be accessed by calling GetDevicePipelineState
    //! with the corresponding device index
