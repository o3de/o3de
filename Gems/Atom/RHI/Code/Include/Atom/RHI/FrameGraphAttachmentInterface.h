        //! This interface exposes FrameGraphAttachmentDatabase functionality to non-RHI systems (like the RPI). This is in order
        //! to reduce access to certain public functions in FrameGraphAttachmentDatabase that are intended for RHI use only.
        //!
        //! Attachment registration for a particular AttachmentId occurs just once per frame. A registration
        //! event makes the attachment immediately visible via the AttachmentId. Any "Use" operation after this call,
        //! either on this scope or a downstream scope, may reference that attachment by AttachmentId.
        //! 
        //! Attachments fall into two categories:
        //! 
        //!   (Imports):
        //!      Persistent attachments owned by the user are imported into the frame scheduler each
        //!      frame. The frame scheduler merely references the attachment; it does not dictate ownership.
        //! 
        //!   (Transients):
        //!      Transient Attachments are owned and managed by the frame scheduler. They persist only for the current frame.
        //!      The user references the transient attachment by AttachmentId, and is able to access resource contents
        //!      in the Compile and Execute phases of a ScopeProducer (via the respective phase contexts).
