         * Draw list tags are unique ids identifying a unique list of draw items. The draw packet
         * contains multiple draw items, where each draw item is associated with a draw list tag.
         *
         * A draw list tag is designed to map to a specific type of draw call; e.g. shadows, forward-opaque,
         * forward-transparent, depth, etc. Multiple instances of these lists will exist (one per view,
         * for example).
         *
         * The number of used tags should be relatively small. As such, they are also stored in a bit mask,
         * which allows for very fast queries when building the draw lists.
         *
         * See also DrawListTagRegistry.
