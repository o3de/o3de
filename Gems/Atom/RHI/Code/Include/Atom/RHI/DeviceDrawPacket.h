    //! DeviceDrawPacket is a packed data structure (one contiguous allocation) containing a collection of
    //! DrawItems and their associated array data. Each draw item in the packet is associated
    //! with a DrawListTag. All draw items in the packet share the same set of shader resource
    //! groups, index buffer, one DrawFilterMask, and draw arguments.
    //! 
    //! Some notes about design and usage:
    //!   - Draw packets should be used to 'broadcast' variations of the same 'object' to multiple passes.
    //!     For example: 'Shadow', 'Depth', 'Forward'.
    //! 
    //!   - Draw packets can be re-used between different views, scenes, or passes. The embedded shader resource groups
    //!     should represent only the local data necessary to describe the 'object', not the full context including
    //!     scene / view / pass specific state. They serve as a 'template'.
    //! 
    //!   - The packet is self-contained and does not reference external memory. Use DeviceDrawPacketBuilder to construct
    //!     an instance and either store in an RHI::Ptr or call 'delete' to release.
