    //! and transient resources are allocated and de-allocated. This is all done from within the
    //! compile phase. Therefore, an allocation may create a resource, but a de-allocation does not
    //! destroy resources! All de-allocation does is inform the pool that a resource can
    //! be re-used within a subsequent scope. The final result of this process is a set of
