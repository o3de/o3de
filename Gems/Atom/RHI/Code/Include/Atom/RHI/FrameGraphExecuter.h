        //! FrameGraphExecuter is a context for executing the scopes of a compiled FrameGraph
        //! on the GPU using the associated device instance. The details of how scopes are executed
        //! are platform specific.
        //!
        //! The goal of this class is enable users to record and submit command lists at a granularity
        //! prescribed by the platform, while also respecting the 'threading' policy of the underlying platform.
        //! Modern platform implementations will allow full multi-threaded recording of command lists, while others
        //! will require serialization onto a single thread.
        //!
        //! To ensure the maximum flexibility for each platform, scope execution is divided into two layers: 'Execute Groups',
        //! and 'Execute Contexts'.
        //!
        //! - Execute Groups contain a list of Execute Contexts. FrameGraphExecuter::GetJobPolicy() describes the policy
        //! for whether groups can be processed serially or independently. Again, the underlying platform assigns this policy.
        //!
        //! - Execute Contexts provides a mapping between a command list and scope. A context can either represent the full
        //! set of work for scope, or it can be 1 in a set of several contexts processing the same scope. The latter scenario
        //! is common in cases where many commands are processed within the same scope and the platform decides to partition the
        //! work across several jobs. Each execute group describes its policy for whether contexts can be recorded independently
        //! on separate threads.
         
        //! The class provides two API's: one for external users (e.g. the FrameScheduler), and one
        //! for the derived platform implementation.
         
        //! To use this class, first call Begin to prepare the executer using a compiled FrameGraph
        //! instance. Then, iterate over the execute groups and process each one (either independently or
        //! serially, depending on the platform policy). Call End to complete processing of the graph.
        //!
        //! To implement this class, assign the job policy specific to your platform, and every Begin call, use the provided
        //! AddGroup method to partition the FrameGraph into execution groups. Each group and context will have platform
        //! specific overrides.
