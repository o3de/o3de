    //! FrameGraphCompiler controls compilation of FrameGraph each frame. FrameScheduler owns
    //! and drives an instance of this class, so end-users should never need to interact with it directly.
    //! Platform implementations, on the other hand, are required to override this class in order to perform
    //! platform-specific scope construction.
    //!
    //! The compiler is designed to be invoked every frame; the graph is simply rebuilt each time. The compile
    //! operation is also done on a single thread; so overhead should be kept to a minimum.
    //!
    //! The RHI base class performs platform-independent compilation before passing control down to the derived
    //! platform implementation. The provided FrameGraph instance is compiled in-place according to the
    //! following phases:
    //!
    //!      == Cross-Queue Graph Edges == 
    //!
    //! FrameGraph contains a graph of Scope instances. Scopes are topologically sorted prior to
    //! compilation as part of the graph construction process. Scopes associate directly to a "Hardware Queue Class":
    //! Graphics, Compute, or Copy. These three queue classes must be synchronized between each other. To make this
    //! easier on platforms, the base compiler takes the topologically flattened graph and collates it into
    //! three independent sorted lists--one for each queue class. Then, a queue-centric producer-consumer graph is
    //! constructed across the scopes. Specifically:
    //!
    //!  class Scope
    //!  {
    //!      Scope* m_producersByQueue[HardwareQueueClassCount];
    //!      Scope* m_consumersByQueue[HardwareQueueClassCount];
    //!  };
    //!
    //! This graph makes it possible to walk along a queue or across queue boundaries at dependency points. Each
    //! platform can then trivially crawl this graph to derive signal / wait fence values, if applicable.
    //!
    //!      == Transient Attachments ==
    //!
    //! Transient attachments are intra-frame and do not persist after the frame ends and can take the form of
    //! buffers or images. These attachments are owned by a DeviceTransientAttachmentPool; every frame, the pool
    //! is reset. Since attachments are always declared for usage on scopes, its full usage chain--and thus its
    //! lifetime across the frame--is immediately available.
    //!
    //! The phase first constructs the scope lifetime for each attachment. Then, memory for each attachment is
    //! allocated from the transient attachment pool, one scope at a time. This allows the pool to record begin
    //! and end usages for each attachment per scope. Internally, the platform implementation can use this
    //! information to place aliased resources onto one or more heaps of memory.
    //!
    //! One important consideration is dealing with aliasing across queue boundaries. Since queues must be
    //! synchronized between each other, attempting to alias memory across two queues at the same time will
    //! produce a race condition. To solve this, when faced with a queue overlap, the compiler extends the
    //! lifetime of the attachment until a join operation occurs. However, the compiler picks a single queue
    //! which is allowed to alias during that region by inspecting which one will see the biggest potential
    //! gain. This way, some aliasing is still allowed when async compute / copy is in use.
    //! 
    //! Finally, because the resources themselves are effectively re-created each frame, a cache of views is
    //! kept inside the compiler. The cache is big enough to avoid having to re-create views every frame, but
    //! bounded in order to release entries old views.
    //! 
    //!      == Platform-Specific Compilation ==
    //! 
    //! Finally, the compiler calls into the platform-specific compile method, which hands control over to the
    //! derived class. The platform implementation is expected to further process the frame graph and scope data
    //! down to platform-specific actions. For example:
    //! 
    //!  1) Derive transition barriers by walking the scope attachment chain on each frame attachment.
    //!  2) Derive queue fence values by walking the queue-centric scope graph.
