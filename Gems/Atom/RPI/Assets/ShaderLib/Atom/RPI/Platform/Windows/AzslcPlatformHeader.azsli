/*
* The shader build pipeline has 2 preprocess stages. The first one happens 
* after appending the Platform and RHI specific AzslcHeader.azsli, which includes this header.
* This file contains defines specific to a platform (e.g. Windows) but shared among all RHI implementations on that platform (e.g. Vulkan, DX12, Null).
* Note that the AssetProcessor uses the Null-RHI platform to process Materials, so anything that modifies SRGs has to go in this file.
