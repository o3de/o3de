// The shader variant system needs a fallback if you have non-static options.
// Include UnusedFallbackDrawSrg.azsli to provide a default draw srg if you don't want
// to actually use anything from the draw srg, but want to define one to use as
// a fallback. This is better than including DefaultDrawSrg, because it decouples
// your shader from changes made to that file.
