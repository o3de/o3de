         * In the append phase, visible object entries (or void* pointers to user data) are added to the context.
         * This is thread-safe and low contention. 
         *
         * Call FinalizeLists to transition to the consume phase. This combines the per-thread data into a single list.
         *
         * Finally, in the consume phase, the context is immutable and lists are accessible via GetList.
