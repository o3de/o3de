    //! EditorGradientPreviewUpdateJob offloads the creation of a gradient preview image to another thread.
    //! This is necessary for Editor responsiveness.  With complex gradient hierarchies, large previews, and/or
    //! multiple gradient previews visible at the same time (like in Landscape Canvas), it's possible for the
    //! preview generation to take multiple seconds, or even minutes in degenerate data cases.
    //!
    //! In offloading the work, we also incrementally update the preview via an adaptive interlacing scheme, similar
    //! to GIF or PNG interlacing, so that it becomes visible and usable even before the work has completed.
    //!
    //! Implementation notes:
    //! - This directly modifies the m_previewImage from a Job thread in a non-threadsafe way while it is also being
    //! used from Qt in the main thread.  This doesn't cause any issues because we synchronously cancel the job thread
    //! any time we delete or recreate m_previewImage (such as during resizing).
    //!
    //! - The interlacing scheme is loosely based on the "Adam7" algorithm, which is used in the PNG format.  Unlike Adam7,
    //! which uses a 7-pass system to operate on 8x8 interlace patterns, the code below uses an N-pass system.  Roughly speaking,
    //! each pass doubles the number of pixels drawn relative to the previous pass.  For a 256x256 image, the passes will draw
    //! 1 pixel, 1 pixel, 2 pixels, 4 pixels, 8 pixels, 16 pixels, 32 pixels, 64 pixels, 128 pixels, ..., 32768 pixels.
    //!
    //! - We only create a single job instance per gradient preview, and the Process() function of the job runs once for
    //! each time we need to refresh the preview.  It remains dormant the rest of the time.  We can't use a fire-and-forget job
    //! because we need the ability to synchronously cancel it and wait for it to be cancelled.  This requirement comes from the
    //! way we reuse data that exists in the parent Preview widget class.  We need to manage the lifetime to be exactly the same
    //! as the widget, and we can't have multiple jobs running in parallel that modify the same widget.  (If we use fire-and-forget,
    //! even if we cancel asynchronously, it would be easy to start a new one before the old one finishes)
