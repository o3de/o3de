# with the cwd being the engine root folder (the one with cmake as a subfolder)
# on the command line, define LY_3RDPARTY_PATH to a valid directory
# and PAL_PLATFORM_NAME to the platform you'd like to get or update python for.
# defines must come before the script call.
# example:
# cmake -DPAL_PLATFORM_NAME:string=Windows -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH:string=%CMD_DIR% -P get_python.cmake
