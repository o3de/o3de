; This file is test test deprecated and is only use currently for setting the path when running O3DE in an engine-centric manner
; By engine-centric, what is meant is using CMake to configure from the <engine-root> directory and passing in the LY_PROJECTS value

project_path=AutomatedTesting

; The Asset Processor Specific settings are now the <engine-root>/Engine/Registry/bootstrap.setreg settings
; The Engine specific settings can be overridden in order of least precedence to most
; 1. Override the settings in a "<gem-root>/Registry/*.setreg(patch)" file (Shared per Gem Settings)
; 2. Override the settings in a "<project-root>/Registry/*.setreg(patch)" file (Shared per Project Settings)
; 3. Override the settings in a "<project-root>/Registry/*.setreg(patch)" file (User per Project Settings)
; 4. Override the settings in a "~/.o3de/Registry/*.setreg(patch)" file (User Global Settings) 
; Where "~" is %USERPROFILE% on Windows and $HOME on Unix like platforms
