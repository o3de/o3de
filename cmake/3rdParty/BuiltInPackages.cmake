# temporary compatibility: 
# Some 3p libraries may still refer to zlib as "3rdParty::zlib" instead of
# the correct "3rdParty::ZLIB" (Case difference).  Until those libraries are updated
# we alias the casing here.  This also provides backward compatibility for Gems that use 3rdParty::zlib
# that are not part of the core O3DE repo.
