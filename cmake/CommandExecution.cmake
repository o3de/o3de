# CMake utility that provides functionality around command execution
# It provides:
# - ability to avoid the execution altogether by creating a .stamp file and comparing it to the "file reference".
#   Related to https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/18530
# - ability to lock the execution by creating a .lock file of the "file reference"
#
# This script has to be invoked like:
# cmake -DLY_LOCK_FILE=<lock file> -P cmake/CommandExecution.cmake EXEC_COMMAND commandToExecute1 <EXEC_COMMAND commandToExecute2> ...
#   In the above case, all the commands will be locked on <lock file>. Meaning that there could be only one instance executing at the
#   the same time. Since we provide flexibility on what file gets locked, multiple invocations could be done with different commands.
#   The lock file acts as a mutex over a certain "resource" that the caller is trying to control access to.
# cmake -DLY_TIMESTAMP_REFERENCE=<referencefile> [-DLY_TIMESTAMP_FILE=<referencefile>] -P cmake/CommandExecution.cmake EXEC_COMMAND commandToExecute1 <EXEC_COMMAND commandToExecute2> ...
#   In this case, the file's timestamp of LY_TIMESTAMP_REFERENCE will be compared to LY_TIMESTAMP_FILE, if newer, it will execute the commands
#   If LY_TIMESTAMP_FILE is not passed, then ${LY_TIMESTAMP_REFERENCE}.stamp is used
#
# If LY_LOCK_FILE and LY_TIMESTAMP_REFERENCE are not passed, then the commands are executed.
#
