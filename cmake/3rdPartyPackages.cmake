# OVERVIEW:
# this is the Open 3D Engine Package system.
# It allows you to host a package on a server and download it as needed when a target
# requests that specific package, or manually whenever you want to do so.
# Most users will just call ly_associate_package(...) to associate a package with a target
# and the system will automatically get that package when a target asks for it as a 
# dependency.  If you want to manually activate a package, you can use ly_download_associated_package
# to bring its find* scripts into scope (and download if needs be)
# and you can also use ly_set_package_download_location(..) to change it to install
# somewhere besides the default install location.

# cache variables:

# LY_PACKAGE_SERVER_URLS:
# missing packages are downloaded from this list of URLS, first one to match wins.
# Besides normal http and https URLs, you can also use FILE urls,
# for example "file:///mnt/d/lyengine/packageSource/packages;file:///d:/lyengine/packageSource/packages"
# also allowed:
# "s3://bucketname" (it will use LYPackage_S3Downloader.cmake to download it from a s3 bucket)
