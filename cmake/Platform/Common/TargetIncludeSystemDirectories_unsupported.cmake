#! ly_target_include_system_directories: adds a system include to the target. This is the same behavior as target_include_directories
#  passing the SYSTEM parameter. However, this supports doing it in generators that CMake still does not.
#
# To handle platforms that yet not support SYSTEM includes, we pass the includes as part of compilation options
# Once all platforms support it, we can roll back to target_include_directories
# We are using the same variable for the system include that CMake does, so this works in all platforms where cmake supports
# it and by defining the variables, it will support it in platforms where the compiler supports it but CMake still didnt
# add it to the generator (e.g. MSVC: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17904)
#
# \arg:TARGET name of the target
# \arg:INTERFACE includes to apply to INTERFACE
# \arg:PUBLIC includes to apply to PUBLIC
# \arg:PRIVATE includes to apply to PRIVATE
