# Currently we are in the DefaultProjectSource folder: ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}
# Get the platform specific folder ${pal_dir} for the current folder: ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Platform/${PAL_PLATFORM_NAME}
# Note: ly_get_list_relative_pal_filename will take care of the details for us, as this may be a restricted platform
#       in which case it will see if that platform is present here or in the restricted folder.
#       i.e. It could here: DefaultProjectSource/Platform/<platorm_name>  or
#            <restricted_folder>/<platform_name>/DefaultProjectSource
