# The key reason we store this in a python file instead is so that we can
# put explanatory comments int the data, which is not supported by JSON.
# There are other possible approaches (such as removing comments with an re after reading the string)
# but they are more work, so for now we just do it this way.

# In regular expressions in this file, do not use patterns that start with ".*", as they make the entire system very slow.
# Even patterns that start with an single "." open match will slow the system down.
# Patterns should start with a match to a specific character, and match as many specific
# characters as possible before using any wildcard matches.
