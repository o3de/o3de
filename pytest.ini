# primary suite markers which should appear on every filterable test and be mutually exclusive:
markers = SUITE_smoke: Tiny, quick tests of fundamental operation (tests with no suite marker will also execute here in CI)
          SUITE_main: Wider tests of system functionality
          SUITE_periodic: low-priority verification, which should not block code submission
          SUITE_benchmark: Benchmarks which do not pass or fail but instead output statistics
          SUITE_sandbox: Temporarly contains flaky/unstable tests, this should not block code submission. This test suite should be ideally empty
          SUITE_awsi: Time consuming AWS integration end-to-end tests
# secondary markers which may appear alongisde a suite marker:
          REQUIRES_gpu: Tests which require a physical GPU
# custom markers not listed above will cause pytest to emit a typo warning
