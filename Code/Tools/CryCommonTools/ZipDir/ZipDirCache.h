// Declarations of the class used to parse and cache Zipped directory.
// This class is actually an auto-pointer to the instance of the cache, so it can
// be easily passed by value.
// The cache instance contains the optimized for memory usage and fast search tree
// of the files/directories inside the zip; each file has a descriptor with the
// info about where its compressed data lies within the file

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// THe Zip Dir uses a special memory layout for keeping the structure of zip file.
// This layout is optimized for small memory footprint (for big zip files)
// and quick binary-search access to the individual files.
//
// The serialized layout consists of a number of directory records.
// Each directory record starts with the DirHeader structure, then
// it has an array of DirEntry structures (sorted by name),
// array of FileEntry structures (sorted by name) and then
// the pool of names, followed by pad bytes to align the whole directory
// record on 4-byte boundray.
