//
// Service network is a simple abstract interface for connecting between instances
// of the editor and game running on various platforms. It implements it's own
// small message based communication layer and shall not be used for raw communication
// with anything else.
//
// Features currently implemented by the service network:
//  - Completely thread safe (so can be used from within other threads)
//  - Completely asynchronous (only one thread)
//  - Message based approach (both on the send and receive ends)
//  - Automatic and transparent reconnection
//  - Debug-friendly (will not time-out easily when one of the endpoints is being debugged)
//  - Easy to use
//
// Usage case (server)
//   - Create listener (IServiceListener) on some pre-defined port
//   - Poll the incoming connections by calling Accept() method
//   - Service the traffic by calling connection's ReceiveMessage()/SendMessage() methods
//   - Close() and Release() connections
//   - Close() and Release() listener
//
// Usage case (client)
//   - Connect to a remote listener by calling Connect() method
//   - Service the traffic by calling connection's ReceiveMessage()/SendMessage() methods
//   - Close() and Release() connection
//
// Both sending and receiving is asynchronous. Calling the SendMessage()/ReceiveMessage() methods
// only pushes/pops the message buffers to/from the queue.
// NOTE: Message buffers are internally reference counted by the network system and they are kept around
// untill they are sent (in case of outgoing traffic) or untill they are polled by ReceiveMessage().
// Be aware that this can cause memory spikes, especially when incoming traffic is not serviced fast enough.
// There are customizable limits (around 1MB) on the amount of data that can be buffered internally by
// the service network before the new messages are rejected.
// It's up to the higher layer to ensure damage control in such situation.
//
// NOTE: connection is also a reference counted object, make sure to call Close() before calling Release().
