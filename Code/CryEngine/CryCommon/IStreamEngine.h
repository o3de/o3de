// This is the prototypes of interfaces that will be used for asynchronous
// I/O (streaming).
// THIS IS NOT FINAL AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE

// Some excerpts explaining basic ideas behind streaming design here:

/*
 * The idea is that the data loaded is ready for usage and ideally doesn't need further transformation,
 * therefore the client allocates the buffer (to avoid extra copy). All the data transformations should take place in the Resource Compiler. If you have to allocate a lot of small memory objects, you should revise this strategy in favor of one big allocation (again, that will be read directly from the compiled file).
 * Anyway, we can negotiate that the streaming engine allocates this memory.
 * In the end, it could make use of a memory pool, and copying data is not the bottleneck in our engine
 *
 * The client should take care of all fast operations. Looking up file size should be fast on the virtual
 * file system in a pak file, because the directory should be preloaded in memory
