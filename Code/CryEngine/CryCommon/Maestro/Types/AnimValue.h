// **NOTE**: Do not include into the precompiled header hierarchy!

//! Values that animation track can hold.
// Do not change values! they are serialized
//
// Attention: This should only be expanded if you add a completely new value type that tracks can control!
// If you just want to control a new parameter of an entity etc. extend EParamType
//
// Note: If the param type of a track is known and valid these can be derived from the node.
//       These are serialized in case the parameter got invalid (for example for material nodes)
