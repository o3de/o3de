        //!     processing the spawnable asset to locked out of doing any asset streaming work. If there are more spawnables doing
        //!     this than there are job threads available the engine will enter a deadlock situation as no more assets can complete
        //!     loading and no job threads become free as they're all waiting for assets to complete. It is however safe to queue
        //!     an asset for loading.
