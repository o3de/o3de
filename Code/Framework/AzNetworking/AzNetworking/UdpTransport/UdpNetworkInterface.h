    //! @class UdpNetworkInterface
    //! @brief This class implements a UDP network interface.
    //!
    //! UdpNetworkInterface is an implementation of AzNetworking::INetworkInterface. Since UDP is a very bare bones protocol,
    //! the Open 3D Engine implementation has to provide significantly more than its TCP counterpart (since TCP implements a
    //! significant number of reliability features.)
    //! 
    //! When sent through UDP, a packet can have additional actions performed on it depending on which features are enabled and
    //! configured. Each feature listed in this description is in the order a packet will see them on Send.
    //! 
    //! ### Packet structure
    //! 
    //! The general structure of a UDP packet is:
    //! 
    //! * Flags - A bitfield a receiving endpoint can quickly inspect to learn about configuration of a packet
    //! * Header - Details the type of packet and other information related to reliability
    //! * Payload - The actual serialized content of the packet
    //! 
    //! For more information, read [Networking Packets](http://o3de.org/docs/user-guide/networking/packets) in the O3DE documentation.
    //! 
    //! ### Reliability
    //! 
    //! UDP packets can be sent reliably or unreliably. Reliably sent packets are registered for tracking first. This causes the
    //! reliable packet to be resent if a timeout on the packet is reached. Once the packet is acknowledged, the packet is
    //! unregistered.
    //! 
    //! ### Fragmentation
    //! 
    //! If the raw packet size exceeds the configured maximum transmission unit (MTU) then the packet is broken into
    //! multiple fragments to avoid fragmentation at the routing level. Fragment reliability is controlled by the cvar
    //! net_FragmentsAlwaysReliable.
    //! When true, fragments are always sent reliably to ensure the source packet can be reconstructed. This means unreliable
    //! packets exceeding MTU will be split into several reliable packets to guarantee delivery but at a cost of extra network processing.
    //! (Default) When false, fragments inherit the reliability type of their source packet. This may cause non-reliable packet
    //! transmission to fail if packet is fragmented, if even one fragment fails to be delivered due to network conditions.
    //!
    //! Optimizing packets to remain under MTU and appropriate usage of reliable packets is recommended before enabling
    //! net_FragmentsAlwaysReliable.
    //! 
    //! Operations that alter the payload generally follow this step so that they can be
    //! separately applied to the Fragments in addition to not being applied to both the original and Fragments.
    //! 
    //! ### Compression
    //! 
    //! Compression here refers to content insensitive compression using libraries like LZ4. If enabled, the target payload is
    //! run through the compressor and replaces the original payload if it's in fact smaller. To tell if compression is enabled
    //! on a given packet, we operate on a bit in the packet's Flags. The Sender writes this bit while the Receiver checks it to
    //! see if a packet needs to be decompressed.
    //! 
    //! O3DE could potentially move from over MTU to under with compression, and the UDP interface doesn't check for this. Detecting a change
    //! that would reduce the number of fragmented packets would require pre-emptively compressing payloads to tell if that change happened,
    //! which could potentially lead to a lot of unnecessary calls to the compressor.
    //! 
    //! ### Encryption
    //! 
    //! AzNetworking uses the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library to implement Datagram Layer Transport Security (DTLS) encryption
    //! on UDP traffic. Encryption operates as described in [O3DE Networking Encryption](http://o3de.org/docs/user-guide/networking/encryption)
    //! on the documentation website. Once both endpoints have completed their handshake, all traffic is expected to be fully encrypted.
