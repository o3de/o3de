     * The DragAndDropEvents bus is intended to act as a proxy for objects handling QT Drag and Drop Events on Widgets.
     * Multiple handlers can register with a single Widget name to handle drag and drop events from that name. 
     * It is the handler authors' responsibility to not conflict with others' drag and drop handlers.
     *
     * See http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.8/dnd.html for more complete documentation on QT Drag and Drop.
     *
     * In general, to use this system, listen on the bus at the address of one of the contexts (see files in AzQtComponents/DragAndDrop/ for contexts)
     * Each time you get any of the events, always check if the event has already been consumed by some other system
     * by examining the event's "isAccepted()" bool property.  If its already accepted by someone, do not do anything yourself.
     * otherwise you may examine the mimeData attached in event->mimeData() and decide whether its relevant or not to your handler.
     * if it is, accept the event yourself.
     * The context is intentionally not const, allowing higher priority handlers to fill the context so that later ones can use it.
