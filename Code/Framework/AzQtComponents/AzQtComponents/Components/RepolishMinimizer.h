/**
 * RAII-style class that will block unneeded polish requests when doing reparenting.
 * When QWidget::setParent() is called that triggers all children to be repolished, which is expensive
 * as all stylesheet rules have to be recalculated.
 *
 * Repolishing is usually only needed if the stylesheet changed. You can use this class to save CPU cycles
 * when you know you're going to trigger setParent() calls that you're sure wouldn't affect any styling.
