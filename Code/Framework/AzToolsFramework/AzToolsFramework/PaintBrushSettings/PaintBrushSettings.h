       Paint brushes have multiple settings that all come together to produce the results that we're used to seeing in
       paint programs. For those who aren't familiar, here's a quick explanation of how it all works.

       Painting consists of "brush strokes", where each stroke consists of pushing a brush against a canvas, moving it, and lifting
       it. Our equivalent is holding down the mouse button, moving the mouse in continuous movements while holding down the button,
       then lifting the button at the end of the stroke. However, instead of a continuous brush stroke, paint programs use something
       closer to pointillism, where the stroke consists of many discrete brush "stamps", where a "stamp" is a single discrete imprint
       of the brush shape.

       With that description in mind, here's how the settings play together:

       Stroke settings:
       - Color: The color of the paint on the paintbrush. This color is fully applied to each brush stroke.
       - Intensity: When using greyscale painting, this replaces color with an intensity from black to white. This color is fully applied to
       each brush stroke.
       - Opacity: The opacity of an entire brush stroke. Because it's per-stroke, a stroke that crosses itself won't blend with
         itself when this opacity setting is lowered. The blending only occurs after the stroke is complete. (A stroke can still
         blend with itself from flow and hardness settings below, just not from the stroke opacity setting)

       - Blend Mode: The blend mode for blending the brush stroke down to the base layer.

       Stamp settings:
       - Size: The size of the paintbrush, which is the size of each stamp.
       - Distance: The amount the brush needs to move before leaving another stamp, expressed in a % of the paintbrush size.
         100% roughly means each stamp will have 0% overlap and be adjacent to each other, where 25% means each stamp will overlap
         by 75% while creating the stroke. If the brush moves back and forth in small amounts, it's possible to get higher amounts
         of overlap, since this is distance of brush movement, not distance between stamps.
       - Flow: The opacity of each stamp. This conceptually maps to the amount of paint flowing through an airbrush.
       - Hardness: The amount of falloff from the center of each stamp, which affects the opacity within each pixel of the stamp.
         This sort of represents how hard the brush is being pressed against the canvas.

       Each brush stroke conceptually occurs on a separate stroke layer that gets blended into the base, and the layer is merged down
       into the base at the end of the stroke. As the brush moves, it creates discrete stamps based on the Size and Distance. Each stamp
       paints per-pixel opacity data into the stroke layer based on the combination of Flow and Hardness. The stroke layer itself is
       then blended down using the Intensity, Opacity, and Blend Mode.
