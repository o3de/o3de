    Summary:
     Create 512 entities with shape colliders and verify stability

    Expected Behavior:
     After 512 Shape Collider entities exist, the editor should not crash or dip in FPS

    Test Steps:
     1) Load the empty level
     2) Create 512 entities with PhysX Shape Collider and Sphere Shape components
     3) Enter/Exit game mode and wait to see if editor crashes
     4) Close the editor

    Note:
     - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
     - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
