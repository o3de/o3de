    Summary:
    Verify that the Terrain texture layer doesn't crash when changing from on a level with a
    terrain component to another level without a terrain component

    Level Description:
        Level C15308217_NoCrash_LevelSwitchWithOutTerrain:
            No entities
        Level C15308217_NoCrash_LevelSwitchWithTerrain:
            Terrain (entity) - PhysX Terrain entity is created in the level

    Expected Behavior:
    Editior should not crash.
    We are switching the levels and validating the entities and checking any crash is happening while 
    switching between levels

    Test Steps:
     1) Open level with PhysX Terrain component
     2) Enter game mode
     3) Retrieve and validate entities
     4) Exit game mode
     5) Open level which doesn't have a PhysX Terrain component
     6) Enter game mode
     7) Wait for WAIT_TIME to check if any crash happens
     8) Exit game mode
     9) Close the editor


    Note:
    - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
    - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
