    Summary:
    A spawner area is created with a Vegetation Shape Intersection Filter. 2 different shape entities are created,
    pinned to the Shape Intersection Filter, and instance counts are verified.

    Expected Behavior:
    The Shape Entity Id reference can be successfully set/updated. Instances spawn only in the specified shape area.

    Test Steps:
     1) Open an existing level, and set view for visual debugging
     2) Create an instance spawner and planting surface
     3) Create child entity with Box Shape
     4) Create child entity with Cylinder Shape
     5) Assign the Intersection Filter to the Box Shape and validate instance counts
     6) Assign the Intersection Filter to the Cylinder Shape and validate instance counts
     7) Remove the shape reference on the Intersection Filter and validate instance counts

    Note:
    - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
    - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
