    Summary:
    An empty level is created. A Vegetation Layer Spawner area is configured. A Vegetation Layer Blocker area is
    configured to block instances in the spawner area.

    Expected Behavior:
    Vegetation is blocked by the configured Blocker area.

    Test Steps:
    1. A simple level is opened
    2. Vegetation Layer Spawner area is created
    3. Planting surface is created
    4. Vegetation System Settings level component is added, and Snap Mode set to center to ensure expected instance
    counts are accurate in the configured vegetation area
    5. Initial instance counts pre-blocker are validated
    6. A Vegetation Layer Blocker area is created, overlapping the spawner area
    7. Post-blocker instance counts are validated

    Note:
    - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
    - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
