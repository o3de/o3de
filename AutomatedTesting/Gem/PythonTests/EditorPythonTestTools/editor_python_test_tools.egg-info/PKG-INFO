        INTRODUCTION
        ------------
        
        EditorPythonBindings is a Python project that contains a collection of editor testing tools
        developed by the Lumberyard feature teams. The project contains tools for system level
        editor tests.
        
        
        REQUIREMENTS
        ------------
        
         * Python 3.7.5 (64-bit)
        
        It is recommended that you completely remove any other versions of Python
        installed on your system.
        
        
        INSTALL
        -----------
        It is recommended to set up these these tools with Lumberyard's CMake build commands.
        Assuming CMake is already setup on your operating system, below are some sample build commands:
            cd /path/to/od3e/
            mkdir windows_vs2019
            cd windows_vs2019
            cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -T host=x64 -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH="%3RDPARTYPATH%" -DLY_PROJECTS=AutomatedTesting
        NOTE:
        Using the above command also adds EditorPythonTestTools to the PYTHONPATH OS environment variable.
        Additionally, some CTest scripts will add the Python interpreter path to the PYTHON OS environment variable.
        
        To manually install the project in development mode using your own installed Python interpreter:
            cd /path/to/od3e/AutomatedTesting/Gem/PythonTests/EditorPythonTestTools
            /path/to/your/python -m pip install -e .
        
        
        UNINSTALLATION
        --------------
        
        The preferred way to uninstall the project is:
         /path/to/your/python -m pip uninstall editor_python_test_tools
