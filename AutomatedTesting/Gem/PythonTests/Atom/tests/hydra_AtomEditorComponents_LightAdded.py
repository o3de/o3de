def AtomEditorComponents_Light_AddedToEntity():

    Summary:
    Tests the Light component can be added to an entity and has the expected functionality.

    Test setup:
    - Wait for Editor idle loop.
    - Open the "Base" level.

    Expected Behavior:
    The component can be added, used in game mode, hidden/shown, deleted, and has accurate required components.
    Creation and deletion undo/redo should also work.

    Test Steps:
    1) Create a Light entity with no components.
    2) Add Light component to the Light entity.
    3) UNDO the entity creation and component addition.
    4) REDO the entity creation and component addition.
    5) Enter/Exit game mode.
    6) Test IsHidden.
    7) Test IsVisible.
    8) Delete Light entity.
    9) UNDO deletion.
    10) REDO deletion.
    11) Look for errors.
