def AtomEditorComponents_ExposureControl_AddedToEntity():

    Summary:
    Tests the Exposure Control component can be added to an entity and has the expected functionality.

    Test setup:
    - Wait for Editor idle loop.
    - Open the "Base" level.

    Expected Behavior:
    The component can be added, used in game mode, hidden/shown, deleted, and has accurate required components.
    Creation and deletion undo/redo should also work.

    Test Steps:
    1) Create an Exposure Control entity with no components.
    2) Add Exposure Control component to Exposure Control entity.
    3) UNDO the entity creation and component addition.
    4) REDO the entity creation and component addition.
    5) Verify Exposure Control component not enabled.
    6) Add Post FX Layer component since it is required by the Exposure Control component.
    7) Verify Exposure Control component is enabled.
    8) Enter/Exit game mode.
    9) Test IsHidden.
    10) Test IsVisible.
    11) Delete Exposure Control entity.
    12) UNDO deletion.
    13) REDO deletion.
    14) Look for errors and asserts.
