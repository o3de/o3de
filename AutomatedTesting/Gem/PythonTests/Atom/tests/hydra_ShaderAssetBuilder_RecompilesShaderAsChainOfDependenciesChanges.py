    This test validates: "Shader Builders May Fail When Multiple New Files Are Added"

    1- The first phase generates the source assets out of order and slowly. The AP should
       wakeup each time one of the source dependencies appears but will fail each time. Only when the
       last dependency appears then the shader should build successfully. 
    2- The second phase is similar as above, except that all source assets will be created
       at once and We also expect that in the end the shader is built successfully.
