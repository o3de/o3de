    Summary:
     EntityA and EntityB will be created in a level. Attached to both will be a Script Canvas component.
     The Script Event created for the test will be sent from EntityA to EntityB.

    Expected Behavior:
     The output of the Script Event should be printed to the console

    Test Steps:
     1) Create test level
     2) Create EntityA/EntityB (add scriptcanvas files part of entity setup)
     3) Enter Game Mode
     4) Read for line
     5) Exit Game Mode


    Note:
     - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
     - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
