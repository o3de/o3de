            Summary: A temporary level is created with an Entity having ScriptCanvas component.
             ScriptEvent(T92569006_ScriptEvent.scriptevents) is created with one Method that has a return value.
             ScriptCanvas(T92569006_ScriptCanvas.scriptcanvas) is attached to Entity. Graph has Send node that sends the Method
             of the ScriptEvent and prints the returned result ( On Entity Activated -> Send node -> Print) and Receive node is
             set to return custom value ( Receive node -> Print).
             Verify that the entity containing T92569006_ScriptCanvas.scriptcanvas should print the custom value set in both
             Send and Receive nodes.

            Expected Behavior:
             After entering game mode, the graph on the entity should print an expected message to the console

            Test Steps:
             1) Open the base level
             2) Create test entity
             3) Start Tracer
             4) Enter Game Mode
             5) Read for line
             6) Exit Game Mode
