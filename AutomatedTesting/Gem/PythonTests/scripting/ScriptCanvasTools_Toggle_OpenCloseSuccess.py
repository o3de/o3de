    Summary:
     Toggle Node Palette, Node Inspector, Bookmarks and Variable Manager in Script Canvas.
     Make sure each pane opens and closes successfully.

    Expected Behavior:
     Each pane opens and closes successfully.

    Test Steps:
     1) Open Script Canvas window (Tools > Script Canvas)
     2) Make sure Node Palette, Node Inspector, Bookmarks and Variable Manager panes are closed in Script Canvas window
     3) Open Node Palette, Node Inspector, Bookmarks and Variable Manager in Script Canvas window
     4) Close Node Palette, Node Inspector, Bookmarks and Variable Manager in Script Canvas window
     5) Restore default layout
     6) Close Script Canvas window

    Note:
     - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
     - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
        Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
