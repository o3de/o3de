    Summary:
     An entity exists in the level that contains a Script Canvas component. In the graph is both a Send Event
     and a Receive Event.

    Expected Behavior:
     After entering game mode the graph on the entity should print an expected message to the console

    Test Steps:
     1) Create test level
     2) Create test entity
     3) Start Tracer
     4) Enter Game Mode
     5) Read for line
     6) Exit Game Mode

    Note:
     - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
     - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
