    Summary:
     Two Entities can use the same Graph asset successfully at RunTime. The script canvas asset
     attached to the entities will print the respective entity names.

    Expected Behavior:
     When game mode is entered, respective strings of different entities should be printed.

    Test Steps:
     1) Create temp level
     2) Create two new entities with different names
     3) Set ScriptCanvas asset to both the entities
     4) Enter/Exit game mode and verify log lines


    Note:
     - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
     - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
