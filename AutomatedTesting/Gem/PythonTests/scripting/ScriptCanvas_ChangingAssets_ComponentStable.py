    Summary:
     Changing the assigned Script Canvas Asset on an entity properly updates level functionality

    Expected Behavior:
     When game mode is entered, respective strings of assigned assets should be printed

    Test Steps:
     1) Create temp level
     2) Create new entity
     3) Start Tracer
     4) Set first script and evaluate
     5) Set second script and evaluate


    Note:
     - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
     - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
