    Summary:
     A test entity contains two Script Canvas components with different unique script canvas files.
     Each of these files will have a print node set to activate on graph start.

    Expected Behavior:
     When game mode is entered, two unique strings should be printed out to the console

    Test Steps:
     1) Create level
     2) Create entity with SC components
     3) Start Tracer
     4) Enter game mode
     5) Wait for expected lines to be found
     6) Report if expected lines were found
     7) Exit game mode

    Note:
     - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
     - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
