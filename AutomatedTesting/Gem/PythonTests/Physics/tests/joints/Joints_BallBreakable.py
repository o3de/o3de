    Summary: Check that ball joint is breakable

    Level Description:
    lead - Starts above follower entity
    follower - Starts below lead entity. Constrained to lead entity with ball joint. Starts with initial velocity of (5, 2, 0).

    Expected Behavior: 
    Lead entity remains still.
    Follower entity moves in the positive X direction, and not much in the Z direction since the joint broke.

    Test Steps:
    1) Open Level
    2) Enter Game Mode
    3) Create and Validate Entities
    4) Wait for several seconds
    5) Check to see if lead and follower behaved as expected
    6) Exit Game Mode
    7) Close Editor

    Note:
    - This test file must be called from the Open 3D Engine Editor command terminal
    - Any passed and failed tests are written to the Editor.log file.
            Parsing the file or running a log_monitor are required to observe the test results.
