    Summary:
    Runs a test to make sure that a networked player can be spawned

    Level Description:
    - Dynamic
        1. Although the level is empty, when the server and editor connect the server will spawn the player prefab.
    - Static
        1. This is an empty level.
                    
    Expected Outcome:
    We should see the player connect and spawn with no errors.
