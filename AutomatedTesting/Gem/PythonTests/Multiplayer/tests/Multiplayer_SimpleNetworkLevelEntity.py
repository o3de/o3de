    Summary:
    Test to make sure that network entities in a level function and are replicated to clients as expected

    Level Description:
    - Static
        1. NetLevelEntity. This is a networked entity which has a script attached which prints logs to ensure it's replicated.
    
                    
    Expected Outcome:
    We should see logs stating that the net-sync'd level entity exists on both server and client.
