    Summary:
    Load level with Entity having Mesh and Cloth components already setup. Verify that editor remains stable in Game mode.

    Expected Behavior:
    The Editor is stable there are no warnings or errors.

    Test Steps:
     1) Load the level
     2) Start the Tracer to catch any errors and warnings
     3) Enter game mode
     4) Wait in game mode some frames to let cloth simulation run
     5) Verify there are no errors and warnings in the logs
     6) Exit game mode
     7) Close the editor

    Note:
    At the time of writing this test it was not possible to set a component property
    with a dropdown, which is necessary to setup a Cloth component. Because of this limitation
    the components of this test are not setup by the script and a level was provided instead.
