These tests are mostly done with files that have a different extension between source and product.
The source scan is done first, and will catch files in the source path.
Product path searching is resolved using "endsWith" logic.
textures/_dev_purple.tif.streamingimage
Back slashes
textures\_dev_stucco.tif.streamingimage
Double back slashes
textures\\_dev_tan.tif.streamingimage
Casing doesn't match
TEXTURES/_DEV_WHITE.tif.streamingimage
Some files have multiple extensions, this verifies that won't trip up the scanner.
