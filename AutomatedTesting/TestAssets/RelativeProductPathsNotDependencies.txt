These tests are mostly done with files that have a different extension between source and product.
The source scan is done first, and will catch files in the source path.
Product path searching is resolved using "endsWith" logic.
textures/_dev_purple.tif.streamingimage
Back slashes, and project name in the path
pc/textures/_dev_stucco.tif.streamingimage
Double back slashes
textures\\_dev_tan.tif.streamingimage
Casing doesn't match
TEXTURES/_DEV_WHITE.tif.streamingimage
Some files have multiple extensions, this verifies that won't trip up the scanner.
textures/_dev_yellow_light.tif.1002.imagemipchain
Path inline textures/milestone2/ama_grey_02.tif.streamingimage test
Path after=textures/_dev_woodland.tif.streamingimage equal sign
