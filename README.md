## Confidentiality; Pre-Release Access  

Welcome to the Project Spectra Private Preview.  This is a confidential pre-release project; your use is subject to the nondisclosure agreement between you (or your organization) and Amazon.  Do not disclose the existence of this project, your participation in it, or any of the  materials provided, to any unauthorized third party.

## Download and Install

This repository uses Git LFS for storing large binary files.  You will need to create a Github personal access token to authenticate with the LFS service.


### Create a Git Personal Access Token

You will need your personal access token credentials to authenticate when you clone the repository.

[Create a personal access token with the 'repo' scope.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)


### (Recommended) Verify you have a credential manager installed to store your credentials 

Recent versions of Git install a credential manager to store your credentials so you don't have to put in the credentials for every request.  
It is highly recommended you check that you have a [credential manager installed and configured](https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core)


### Clone the repository 

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/aws/o3de.git
Cloning into 'o3de'...

# enter your Github username and personal access token

```

If you have the Git credential manager core installed, you should not be prompted for your credentials anymore.

## Building the Engine
### Build Requirements and redistributables

*   Visual Studio 2019 16.9.2 (All versions supported, including Community): [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    *   Install the following workloads:
        *   Game Development with C++
        *   MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86
*   Visual C++ redistributable: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other-family](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other-family)
*   FBXSDK for VS2015: [https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2016-1-2](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2016-1-2)
*   WWise - 2019.2.8.7432: [https://www.audiokinetic.com/download/](https://www.audiokinetic.com/download/)
*   CMake 3.19.1: [https://cmake.org/files/LatestRelease/cmake-3.19.1-win64-x64.msi](https://cmake.org/files/LatestRelease/cmake-3.19.1-win64-x64.msi)

### Build Steps

1.  Download the 3rdParty zip file from here: **[https://d2c171ws20a1rv.cloudfront.net/3rdParty-windows-no-symbols-rev12.zip](https://d2c171ws20a1rv.cloudfront.net/3rdParty-windows-no-symbols-rev12.zip)**
2.  Unzip this file into a writable folder. This will also act as a cache location for the 3rdParty downloader by default (configurable with the `LY_PACKAGE_DOWNLOAD_CACHE_LOCATION` environment variable)
3.  Install the following redistributables to the following:
    - Visual Studio and VC++ redistributable can be installed to any location
    - FBXSDK should be installed to `<3rdParty path>\FbxSdk\2016.1.2-az.1`. See the README in this folder for details
    - WWise should be installed to: `<3rdParty Path>\Wwise\2019.2.8.7432`
    - CMake should be installed to: `<3rdParty Path>\CMake\3.19.1`
4.  Add the following environment variables through the command line
    ```
    set LY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<Location of the unzipped 3rdParty zip>
    set LY_PACKAGE_SERVER_URLS="https://d2c171ws20a1rv.cloudfront.net"
    ```
    
5.  Configure the source into a solution using this command line, replacing <your build location> to a path you've created
    ```
    cmake -B <your build location> -S <source-dir> -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=%LY_3RDPARTY_PATH% -DLY_UNITY_BUILD=ON -DLY_PROJECTS=AutomatedTesting
    ```

6.  Alternatively, you can do this through the CMake GUI:
    
    1.  Start `cmake-gui.exe`
    2.  Select the local path of the repo under "Where is the source code"
    3.  Select a path where to build binaries under "Where to build the binaries"
    4.  Click "Configure"
    5.  Wait for the key values to populate. Fill in the fields that are relevant, including `LY_3RDPARTY_PATH`, `LY_PACKAGE_SERVER_URLS`, and `LY_PROJECTS`
    6.  Click "Generate"
    
7.  The configuration of the solution is complete. To build the Editor and AssetProcessor to binaries, run this command inside your repo:
    ```
    cmake --build <your build location> --target AutomatedTesting.GameLauncher AssetProcessor Editor --config profile -- /m
    ```
   
8.  This will compile after some time and binaries will be available in the build path you've specified

### Setting up new projects    
1. Setup new projects using this command
    ```
    <Repo path>\scripts\o3de.bat create-project --project-path <New project path>
    ```
2.  Once you're ready to build the project, run the same set of commands to configure and build:
    ```
    cmake -B <your build location> -S <source-dir> -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=%LY_3RDPARTY_PATH% -DLY_PROJECTS=<New project name> -DLY_MONOLITHIC_GAME=1

    cmake --build <your build location> --target <New Project Name> --config profile -- /m
    ```
